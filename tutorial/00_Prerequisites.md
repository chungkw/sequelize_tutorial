# Prerequisites

In this tutorial in learning the ORM library Sequelize, you should know:

- How promises work
- How to use async/await
- Basic OOP in JS, such as classes and their object instances

Some other nice to know features of JS are:

- [Array and object destructuring](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment) - quickly assign values out of an array or object
- [Object property shorthand](https://alligator.io/js/object-property-shorthand-es6) - assign a variable into an object as a property, with the name of the variable
- [Variable/computed object keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#computed_property_names) - to use a variable as a key in an object

Without any further ado, let's start.
