# Sequelize Tutorial

This is a Sequelize tutorial, with an example Express server to demonstrate various features of Sequelize.

I will be using Sequelize with MySQL in this tutorial.

This tutorial will cover basics in model definitions and making queries, one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, as well as paranoid models and transactions.
